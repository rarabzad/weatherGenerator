# Generate Synthetic Weather Ensembles

This repository contains a function that generates synthetic temperature and precipitation ensembles from historical daily data. The function uses **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** for seasonality and **ARIMA models** for residual dynamics. The generated ensembles can be used for various climate modeling and analysis tasks.

## Description

The function `generate_weather` generates synthetic temperature and precipitation ensembles by modeling seasonality in the data using three available methods:
- **DOY (Day of Year)**: Uses cyclic splines based on the day of year (DOY) for modeling seasonality.
- **Month-Day**: Models temperature and precipitation using factors for month and day of month.
- **Hybrid**: Combines the DOY and month effects for temperature, while precipitation is modeled directly from input.

Residuals from seasonal models are modeled using ARIMA for temperature and GAMs for precipitation.

## Function Usage

```r
generate_weather(temp_xts, precip_xts, n_ensembles = 5, temp_method = "doy", precip_method = "doy")
```

### Arguments
- **temp_xts**: An `xts` object containing daily historical temperature values.
- **precip_xts**: An `xts` object containing daily historical precipitation values.
- **n_ensembles**: Integer, the number of ensemble members to generate. Default is 5.
- **temp_method**: Method used for temperature simulation. One of `"doy"`, `"month_day"`, or `"hybrid"`.
- **precip_method**: Method used for precipitation simulation. One of `"doy"`, `"month_day"`, or `"hybrid"`.

### Returns

A list with two components:
- **temperature**: An `xts` object containing the synthetic temperature ensembles. Columns are named `temp_1`, `temp_2`, etc.
- **precipitation**: An `xts` object containing the synthetic precipitation ensembles. Columns are named `precip_1`, `precip_2`, etc.

### Details

Each method defines a different approach for modeling seasonality in the data. The residuals from the seasonal models are treated separately with stochastic processes (ARIMA for temperature and a two-stage model for precipitation).

#### DOY Method

For temperature:
- \[
T(d) = f_1(\text{DOY}_d) + \varepsilon_d
\]
Where \(f_1\) is a smooth cyclic spline fit using `s(doy, bs = "cc")` in a GAM, and the residuals \(\varepsilon_d\) are modeled using `auto.arima`.

For precipitation:
- **Occurrence model (wet/dry)**: 
  \[
  \text{logit}(p_d) = f_2(\text{DOY}_d)
  \]
- **Amount model (Gamma)**: 
  \[
  \log(\mu_d) = f_3(\text{DOY}_d) \quad \text{for days with precipitation}
  \]
Both \(f_2\) and \(f_3\) are GAMs using cyclic splines on the day of year.

#### Month-Day Method

For temperature:
- \[
T(d) = \alpha_{m_d, dom_d} + \varepsilon_d
\]
Where \(\alpha_{m, dom}\) is a categorical effect of month and day-of-month, and the residuals \(\varepsilon_d\) are modeled using `auto.arima`.

For precipitation:
- **Occurrence model**: 
  \[
  \text{logit}(p_d) = \beta_{m_d, dom_d}
  \]
- **Amount model**: 
  \[
  \log(\mu_d) = \gamma_{m_d, dom_d} \quad \text{(only for wet days)}
  \]
These are GAMs with factor smooths on month and day.

#### Hybrid Method

For temperature:
- \[
T(d) = f_4(\text{DOY}_d) + f_5(\text{Month}_d) + \varepsilon_d
\]
Where \(f_4\) and \(f_5\) are smooth terms using cyclic splines on DOY and Month, respectively. Precipitation is not modeled stochastically in this method and is reused from the input.

### Synthetic Weather Simulation

For all methods, synthetic daily temperature and precipitation are simulated as follows:

- Temperature:
  \[
  T^{(e)}_d = \hat{f}(d) + \varepsilon^{(e)}_d
  \]
  
- Precipitation:
  \[
  P^{(e)}_d = 
  \begin{cases}
    \text{Gamma}(\mu_d) & \text{if wet day} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]
Where \(\mu_d\) is the predicted mean precipitation from the GAM, and "wet day" is drawn from a Bernoulli with probability \(p_d\).

Progress bars are shown for ensemble generation steps using `txtProgressBar()`.
